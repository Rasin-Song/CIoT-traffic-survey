## Conference and Journal List
We refer to some well-known public lists of academic conferences and journals in the field of network security. We particularly emphasize conferences and journals in the A and B categories related to network and information security, computer networks, high-performance computing, and systems software and software engineering. Based on these sources, we categorize the journals and conferences into classes A and B by comprehensively evaluating their rankings across the above lists: [Conference and journal about A and B](https://github.com/Rasin-Song/CIoT-traffic-survey/blob/main/Conference%20and%20Journal%20List.md)

## Paper List
We divide existing work into 5 major categories: 

A. Device Fingerprinting

B. User Activity Inference
